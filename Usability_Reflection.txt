The website's navigation is straightforward, with a simple, user-friendly layout that facilitates exploration. Colors with high contrast promote readability, which is beneficial to individuals with visual impairments. However, for people with disabilities, interoperability with screen readers and keyboard navigation is critical. Typography and color selection improve legibility, but more attention on interactive aspects for greater feedback would improve user experience. Using ARIA features and semantic HTML could help to boost accessibility even more. Overall, while the site layout and color design are user-friendly, more accessibility options for visually impaired visitors may be implemented.
